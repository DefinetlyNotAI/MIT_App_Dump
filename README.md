# MIT App Inventor File Dump
Just a dump for any MIT APP INVENTOR application I make.

They are in `.aip` form

Made for HackClub

To actually use these go to this [website](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/)
Then you need to sign in, and click on Projects > Import .aia from my computer > Select the .aia you want to view

Code is written in BLOCK language - Not a real language!
